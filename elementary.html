        Gross Domestic Product
    </h5>
    <p><b>
        It's not just size, growth also matters</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the most common measure to estimate the size of a country’s<br />
      economy. It represents the total value of final goods and services produced domestically, in a<br />
      given time period. India’s GDP was approximately USD 2.3 trillion for financial year 2015. What this<br />
      means is that the total value of final goods and services produced inside the geographical<br />
      boundary of India between April 2014 and March 2015 was USD 2.3 trillion.<br /><br />
      GDP calculation only includes value of final goods and services, as the value of intermediary<br />
      goods & services will automatically be included in the final price. For example, GDP doesn’t<br />
      include the value/price of a computer chip, as the same is included in price of a computer when it<br />
      is sold. When calculating GDP, all end goods and services manufactured within the country is<br />
      considered, regardless of the country of origin of the manufacturing company. So the value of a<br />
      Samsung mobile manufactured in India will be included in GDP, even though Samsung is a foreign <br />
      company.<br /><br />
      GDP growth rate is the percentage change in GDP, compared to the previous financial year. It is<br />
      commonly used to see how many additional goods and services were produced, compared to the<br />
      previous year. It is also helpful in comparing two different economies. If GDP growth rate of India<br />
      is 7.5% and that of China is 7.0%, it means that Indian economy is expanding faster than China’s.<br />
      However, this does not tell us anything about the overall size of the economy – which is measured<br />
      by the absolute GDP number.<br /><br />
      Let us consider a small example to understand this.<br /><br />
      Suppose, last year, India’s GDP was USD 1000 and GDP of china was USD 10,000. This year, GDP<br />
      growth rate of India is 9% and that of China is 6%. This means, the value of additional goods and<br />
      services produced by India is USD 90 (9%*1,000) and that in China is USD 600 (6%*10,000). Thus, <br />
      we can say that India is expanding rapidly, but the absolute value of additional goods and <br />
      services, produced by India, is still less than China’s because of China’s higher base (previous<br />
      year’s GDP).<br /><br />
      GDP per capita is defined as the total GDP divided by the total population. A higher GDP per <br />
      capita signifies a higher living standard, as more number of goods and services are available for <br />
      each individual within the country.<br /><br />
    </p><br />
      <h5 id="Inflation">
          Inflation
      </h5>
      <p><b>
          Investing in FDs thinking you will earn 8% returns?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        From an individual investor’s perspective, inflation is one of the most important indicators to<br />
        understand and track. Inflation indicates an overall increase in the general price level of goods<br />
        and services in a country. When we read that last year inflation was 7%, it doesn’t mean that price<br />
        of every product like milk, cars, clothes, etc., increased by 7%. It means compared to the previous<br />
        year  on average prices of all goods and services increased by 7%.<br /><br />
        Each one of us would have definitely experienced the impact of inflation in our lives. In 90s, our<br />
        overall college education fees never used to be more than few thousand rupees, but now it’s<br />
        always in lakhs and crores. We know that since our childhood, prices of almost all goods and<br />
        services have jumped manyfold. Let’s take a basic example:<br /><br />
        <b>2005:</b> You have Rs 100 and price of a cigarette is Rs 5. You can buy 20 cigarettes with Rs 100.<br /><br />
        <b>2015:</b> You have the same Rs 100, but the price of a cigarette has increased from Rs 5 to Rs 12. Now<br />
        instead of 20, you can buy only 8 cigarettes.<br /><br />
        This example clearly shows how inflation reduces value of money. Over a period of time, the same<br />
        amount of money will buy less units of the same good, thereby reducing the individual’s<br />
        purchasing power. Hence it is very important to invest one’s money and grow it.<br />
        </p>
        <h1>Over the last decade, average inflation in India was around <br />
          8.4%. After-tax average rate of return on fixed deposits<br />
          (assuming tax @ 20%) was around 6.2%. Thus, by investing<br />
          in FDs you were actually reducing the value of your money by <br />
          2.2% every year, instead of growing it.<br />
        </h1>
        <p><br /><br /><br />
          Now that we know what inflation is, we need to understand what causes it. Inflation depends on<br />
          price, which is determined by demand and supply. So if people have more money leading to<br />
          more demand than supply, price increases. This is called demand pull inflation and is caused by<br />
          too much money chasing too few goods. On the other hand, if supply is less compared to<br />
          demand, again prices increase and cause inflation. This is called supply push inflation.<br /><br />
          During the last decade, average annual inflation in India was around 8.4%. After tax average<br />
          annual rate of return on fixed deposits (assuming tax @ 20%) was around 6.2%. Thus, by investing<br />
          in FDs you were actually reducing the value of your money by approximately 2.2% every year,<br />
          instead of growing it. The rate of return on savings deposit account is always less than return on<br />
          fixed deposit (FD) and interest rate on bonds are comparable with returns on fixed deposits. So<br />
          after accounting for inflation, any individual who invested in savings account deposit, fixed<br />
          deposits or bonds actually lost money in the real sense. During the same decade, stock markets<br />
          generated an after-tax average annual return of 16%! Certainly makes sense to start investing in<br />
          equity and stop losing money investing in bonds and FD’s.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <h5 id="Stagflation">
              Stagflation
          </h5>
          <p><b>
              Inflation's nefarious cousin</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            You just learnt about inflation and how it is important to invest in instruments that earn higher rate<br />
            of return compared to inflation. Now let’s explore a similar sounding concept called stagflation.<br /><br />
            Stagflation is a situation where economy is stagnating, i.e. it is not experiencing any GDP growth<br />
            and at the same time there is also high inflation. It is a nightmare situation for any country, as high<br />
            prices kill purchasing power and harm the poor, while low or negative GDP growth worsens the<br />
            situation by causing unemployment.<br /><br />
            Now the basic question is how does a country get into such a mess? There could be many<br />
            reasons, but the concept of “supply shock” allows us to understand the causes of stagflation the<br />
            best. Suppose tomorrow all oil producing nations decide to cut supply and suddenly there is<br />
            shortage of oil everywhere. Obviously the price of oil will start increasing. Oil is the lifeblood of<br />
            any economy as it is used in various activities like transportation, power generation,<br />
            manufacturing of goods etc. Thus rising oil price will push up prices of all goods. Consider<br />
            oranges, to get farm produced oranges to a far off market, there is a huge transportation cost<br />
            involved which will increase with rising oil prices. Keeping this in mind, let’s look at the following<br />
            flow chart:<br /><br /><img src="stagflation.png" alt="stagflation" class="stag"><br />
            Unemployment is another closely watched indicator to decide the state of an economy. Read on<br />
            to understand what it means.<br /><br />
          </p><br />
          <h5 id="unemployment">
            Unemployment
          </h5>
          <p><b>
              One of the most dreaded words in economics</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Employment is the primary source of income for majority of the people. If less number of people<br />
            are employed, it results in less expenditure in the economy thereby leading to lower GDP growth.<br />
            This will be explained in detail in our article on measuring GDP. Generally high unemployment rate<br />
            signals recession and problems with the economy. Thus it is very important to observe and track<br />
            unemployment levels in an economy to determine its health.<br /><br />
            Let’s try to understand this concept with an example. Suppose, there is a tiny island called<br />
            Wonderland. The total population of Wonderland is 30,000. Out of these 30,000 people, 5,000<br />
            are below the age of 16 which is the minimum working age on the island. So working age<br />
            population on the island is 25,000 (30,000 – 5,000). Labor force includes all the people who are<br />
            willing and able to work. So students, retirees, disabled people and homemakers won’t be<br />
            included in the labor force. Most of the people whom we just mentioned are the ones who are not<br />
            able to work due to various reasons, but labor force also excludes people who are not willing to<br />
            work. There might be few people who are very rich; too lazy to go out for work; or just tired of<br />
            searching for a job. These people are also not included in the labor force, as they are not willing or<br />
            actively seeking to work. Let’s again assume that amongst the working age population, 5000<br />
            people are either not able to work or are not willing to work. So the island’s labor force,<br />
            representing people who are able and willing to work, would be 20,000 (25,000-5,000). Now let’s<br />
            understand labor force participation rate:<br /><br /></p>
            <h6>Labor force participation rate = (Labor Force/Population above the minimum working age)*100</h6>
            <p>
            In our example this would be 80% (=20,000/25,000*100). This represents the ratio of  willing and<br />
            able to work people within working age population over total working age population.  Labor<br />
            force consists of both – people who are employed and the ones who are not. A person is called<br />
            unemployed if he is able and willing to work, but does not have a job right now. Unemployment<br />
            rate is the percentage of people in labor force who do not have a jobs.<br /><br /></p>
            <h6>Unemployment rate = (Unemployed People/Labor Force)*100</h6>
            <p>
            Let’s say, in wonderland 2,000 people do not have a job, but are able, willing and actively seeking<br />
            employment. Then unemployment rate would be 10% (=2,000/20,000*100). If after a year<br />
            unemployment rate goes down to 5% and nothing else changes, it means many jobs were created<br />
            last year due to which there are less number of unemployed people now. Jobs are created when<br />
            new factories and production plants are setup. Factories are setup to produce more goods and<br />
            services, and as we learnt in our first article, more goods and services translate to higher GDP.<br />
            Thus, a low unemployment rate generally represents a healthy economy and vice versa.<br /><br />
            Now let’s see how these variables change with change in business cycles, as an economy<br />
            progresses.<br /><br />
          </p><br />
          <h5 id="Business Cycles">
              Business Cycles
          </h5>
          <p><b>
              Curves always matter</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s consider an example. Suppose you own a small chocolate factory in India. Most of the major<br />
            festivals – Diwali, Eid, Dussehra, Christmas etc. lie during the second half of the year. During this<br />
            festive season, lot of people buy your chocolate boxes to gift their loved ones. So every year, as<br />
            the second half approaches, your weekly sales start increasing with more and more people<br />
            buying chocolate boxes. Your weekly sales peak’s sometime in the middle of the second half of<br /><br />
            the year and then again starts decreasing slowly, as the first half of the next year approaches. It<br />
            bottoms out during the middle of the first half of the next year and again starts increasing, as the<br />
            festive half of the year approaches. If you try and plot your weekly sales, it might look something<br />
            like the chart below. But this chart assumes that you are not growing and on an average, are<br />
            producing the same number of chocolate boxes every year.<br /><br />
            <img src="bc.png" alt="business cycles" class="bc"><br />
            Now suppose, your company is experiencing rapid growth and producing and selling more and<br />
            more chocolate boxes every year. You are opening new plants and rapidly expanding your<br />
            operations. So average number of chocolate boxes produced by your firm, in a year, keeps on<br />
            increasing with time, but you will still be facing same seasonal fluctuation in sales due to festivals.<br />
            Now in this case, if you plot your weekly sales, it will look something like the chart below.<br /><br />
            <img src="bc1.png" alt="business cycles" class="bc"><br />
            You can easily extend this concept to the whole economy. In this case we will plot GDP, instead of<br />
            weekly sales. Now the time period might not be a fixed one, like one year in our example. It could<br />
            be several years, and cycles could be smaller or bigger. Actual GDP during a period could<br />
            fluctuate due to reasons like increased investments, reform oriented government, rising<br />
            consumer spending etc.<br /><br />
            During expansionary phase – GDP growth increases, unemployment rate is low and inflation<br />
            increases. As explained in demand pull inflation, growth in GDP leads to higher income, resulting<br />
            in higher spending. Increased spending drives prices higher, hence higher inflation. While in the<br />
            case of contraction – GDP growth decreases (sometimes even becomes negative), unemployment<br />
            rate increases and inflation decreases. Generally, when an economy enters the contraction phase<br />
            and experiences two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, it is termed as recession.<br /><br />
          </p><br />
          <h5 id="Indexation">
              Indexation
          </h5>
          <p>
            The profit that you make on selling a long-term capital asset is called a long-term capital gain. But<br />
            as you know, inflation erodes the value of money. For instance, the value of Rs 100 was worth<br />
            more 10 yrs ago than what it is today. That is why when computing the gains on selling a capital<br />
            asset, it is important to adjust the purchase price to account for inflation.<br /><br />
            This is done by way of indexation, a method used to reduce tax liability on selling a capital gain.<br />
            Indexation accounts for inflation from the year of purchase of an asset to the year of sale.</p>
            <h6>How does indexation work?</h6>
            <p>
            Capital asset: This is an asset that you hold for over a year with an intention to not to resell but<br />
            derive benefits from it for a longer period of time. These can be financial securities, real estate,<br />
            and so on in the form of short- or long-term assets. But for the purpose of indexation, we shall<br />
            focus on long-term capital assets—held for 12 to 36 months depending on the asset class.<br /><br />
            Capital gain: The profit you earn on selling a capital asset after you have held it for a minimum<br />
            holding period is called a capital gain. So when you sell a residential property after holding it for<br />
            at least 3 yrs, the profit you make thereon is a long-term capital gain. Simply put, a capital gain is<br />
            a difference between the sale price and the purchase price of a capital asset. As with any other<br />
            taxable income, long-term capital gain also attracts income tax.<br /><br />
            For instance, if you had bought a residential property for Rs 10 lakh in Mar 2003 and sold it for Rs <br />
            35 lakh in Mar 2020, then you have earned a capital gain of Rs 25 lakh. Here, the property is a <br />
            long-term capital asset and the profit is long-term capital gain, which attracts income tax. <br />
            Assuming the rate of tax on long-term capital gains is 10%, your tax liability on the sale of the <br />
            property would be Rs 2,50,000! But thanks to indexation, you don’t have to pay tax on Rs 25 lakh. <br />
            Here’s why.<br /><br />
            As mentioned, indexation inflates the purchase price of an asset. Keeping the sale price of the <br />
            asset constant, a lower purchase price increases your capital gain and tax liability. On the <br />
            contrary, a higher purchase price decreases long-term capital gain and tax thereon. For this <br />
            purpose, you ascertain the indexed cost of acquisition. Meaning adjusting Rs 10 lakh for inflation <br />
            over 17 yrs of holding period so it reflects today’s value.<br /><br />
            The rate of inflation considered here is derived from the government’s Cost Inflation Index (CII), <br />
            available on the income tax department’s website. Once you have the CII data, you can calculate <br />
            the indexed cost of acquisition of the asset or its inflation-adjusted value as follows:<br /><br />
            Indexed cost of acquisition = Original cost of acquisition x (CII of the year of the sale/CII of year of <br />
            purchase)<br /><br />
            In our example, the indexed cost of acquisition of the residential property = Rs 10 lakh x (280/105) <br />
            = Rs 26,66,667<br /><br />
            Effectively, the capital gains will now be Rs 8,33,333 (Rs 35,00,000 minus Rs 26,66,667) as against <br />
            Rs 25 lakh before indexation. Naturally, your tax on capital gain also reduces to Rs 83,333 <br />
            as against Rs 2,50,000 before indexation.<br /><br />
            By now you may have understood the benefit of indexation. It helps reduce your long-term capital <br />
            gains and, in turn, brings down your overall taxable liability.
