        Real Interest Rate
    </h5>
    <p><b>
        It's all relative</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend you read our post on inflation, as the discussion there will be very helpful in <br />
      understanding this article. Interest rate is one of the most common economic terms that we use <br />
      in daily life. Simply put, interest rate is the return earned on money lent out. So if you lend Rs 100 <br />
      to your friend and ask her to give back Rs 110 after one year, interest rate charged by you is 10%. <br />
      Similarly, if you put Rs 100 in your bank account, the bank will pay interest as in this case it’s the <br />
      bank who is taking money from you. If the bank offers an interest rate of 4%, then after one year <br />
      you will get Rs 104 from the bank and will earn Rs 4 as interest.<br /><br />
      This interest rate that we just discussed and the ones that we generally hear & read about is <br />
      called the nominal interest rate. Now let’s see why nominal interest rate is not very relevant. The <br />
      basic motive behind investing money is to earn returns/interest that allows us to retain <br />
      purchasing power as well as to grow the savings kitty. This should allow us to improve our <br />
      standard of living over a period of time. Let us consider an example. Suppose, you have Rs <br />
      1,00,000 and want to buy a high-end motor bike costing Rs 1,08,000. You decide to invest your <br />
      money in a fixed deposit at 9% interest rate. You thought that you will have Rs 1,09,000 at the end <br />
      of the year and will easily buy your favourite bike.<br /><br />
      But after one year, you realize that the price of the bike has gone up to Rs 1,15,000 (increased by <br />
      approx 6.5%). You are sad, as again you cannot buy the bike. What really happened here? Due to <br />
      general inflation of around 6.5% in the economy, price of the bike increased proportionately <br />
      during the course of the year. So in order to achieve your target of buying the bike you should <br />
      have invested in an instrument that returned 15%  after a year. That would have allowed you to <br />
      beat inflation of 6.5% and in addition earn real returns of 8.5%.<br /><br />
      <b>Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate – Inflation Rate</b><br /><br />
      In our example nominal interest rate is 9% and inflation is 6.5% and hence real interest rate is 2.5% <br />
      (9%- 6.5%). When we invest our money, some part of what we are earning is always being eaten <br />
      away by inflation.<br /><br />
      Investors will be able to retain their purchasing power only when they earn returns equal to or <br />
      more than the inflation rate. Suppose the inflation rate is 9% and interest rate is 8%, in real sense <br />
      you will actually lose 1% of your money, rather than gain anything. So rather than being able to <br />
      buy more things after a year, you won’t even be able to buy the same basket of  goods bought <br />
      earlier, as their market price will be higher than your investment kitty.<br /><br />
      Compared to savings bank accounts, fixed deposits, bonds and other instruments, only equities <br />
      as an asset class have generated positive real rate of return in the last decade. To make money in <br />
      real sense over the long term, invest in equities.<br /><br />

          Value of Currency
      </h5>
      <p><b>
          Why currencies rise and fall</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Foreign exchange market (FX, currency market) can be thought of as a global network of banks <br />
        and financial institutions, selling and buying currencies from each other; an Indian bank buying <br />
        Dollars by paying in Rupees, a European bank buying Rupees by paying in Dollars etc. Suppose <br />
        you are planning a trip to Australia and need Aussie Dollars for being able to buy goods and <br />
        services in Australia. You can go to your local bank like HDFC/ICICI or a currency dealer and can <br />
        buy Aussie Dollar by paying in Rupees. Instead of an individual, suppose there is an Indian <br />
        automobile manufacturer who wants to import auto parts manufactured in Japan. The company <br />
        will have to pay in Japanese Yen to buy these auto parts. So it will buy Yen from a bank or a dealer <br />
        by paying in Rupee and then pay Yen to the company from which it is buying these parts. Just like <br />
        you and this company, there are hundreds of thousands of individuals and companies around the <br />
        world seeking foreign currency for various reasons. They go to their banks and dealers for their <br />
        needs and these banks and dealers deal with each other to fulfil the needs of such individuals and <br />
        companies. Hence currency market can be described as an interconnected network of these institutions.<br /><br />
        Every day in the newspapers, we keep reading that currency is falling or that the government <br />
        is doing nothing about currency deprecation etc. The natural question is why is this so important <br />
        that it needs so much of our attention and why does currency actually fall or rise? First, let’s <br />
        discuss the second part of our question. Just like other goods and services, price of a currency is <br />
        also determined by its demand and supply. Suppose today price of USD 1 is Rs 62. Now assume, <br />
        lot of Indians suddenly start travelling to USA or many Indian companies start buying products <br />
        from the USA or many Indians start investing in the US in the hope of better opportunities, all <br />
        these activities will lead to greater demand for US Dollars from India. We have already learnt that <br />
        as demand for a product/service increases, price of the same also increases. So now USD 1 <br />
        becomes RS 65 ie we need to pay more, in order to buy USD 1. In this example, USD appreciated <br />
        with respect to Rupee by 4.84% [(65-62)/62]. In an opposite case when demand for USD <br />
        decreases, its price will decrease and we will have to pay less. Suppose USD 1 becomes equal to <br />
        RS 60. In this case, USD depreciated with respect to Rupee by 3.23% [(62-60)/62]. It is important <br />
        to understand that if demand for USD is increasing from India, it doesn’t mean that it’s increasing <br />
        from rest of the world as well. So USD might not appreciate against other currencies, as its <br />
        demand is increasing only against Rupee.<br /><br />
        So when a currency appreciates, it means we need to pay more in order to buy 1 unit of the <br />
        currency. Similarly if currency depreciates, we need to pay less in order to buy 1 unit. As you <br />
        might have already noticed, price of one currency is given in another currency. In our example, <br />
        price of USD was given in Rupee. So when one currency in the pair appreciates, another is <br />
        depreciating simultaneously and vice versa. Let’s say initially USD 1 = INR 60 or 1 INR = 1/60 USD. <br />
        Now USD depreciates. This means we will have to pay less to buy 1 USD. Suppose it becomes <br />
        1USD = 58 INR. So INR 1 becomes USD 1/58. Initially we had to pay USD 1/60 to buy INR 1, but now <br />
        we will have to pay USD 1/58, which is more. Thus, Rupee appreciated when USD depreciated. <br />
        Hence, we say that for a currency pair, if one currency is appreciating, the other depreciates and <br />
        vice versa.<br /><br />
        To understand the first part of our question, that why this appreciation and depreciation is so important, <br />
        read on.<br /><br />

              Currency Appreciation & Depreciation
          </h5>
          <p><b>
              Not too much, not too little.. just right</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s continue our discussion on currency market and movements that we started in our previous <br />
            article. We just understood what a currency market is and why currency appreciates and/or <br />
            depreciates. In this article let’s try to understand why this upward/downward movement of <br />
            currency is so important.<br /><br />
            Suppose you want to import a costly laser machine from USA. The cost of machine is USD 1000. <br />
            Currently the conversion rate given to you by your dealer is USD 1 = INR 65. So as of today, you will <br />
            have to spend INR 65,000 to buy this machine. Due to some issues, you postpone your purchase <br />
            and decide to buy it next month. Meanwhile due to reasons beyond your control, USD <br />
            appreciates. We know that USD appreciation means INR depreciation. Thus, we will have to pay <br />
            more in order to buy each unit of Dollar. Now after one month, you again ask for a quote from your <br />
            dealer and he quotes USD 1 = INR 70. Thus, you will now have to pay more to import the same <br />
            machine because of USD appreciation (INR depreciation).<br /><br />
            Let’s take another example. Suppose you manufacture cycles. You want to export one cycle to US <br />
            for INR 6000. The person importing this cycle in US will have to pay in INR and thus asks for a <br />
            quote from his dealer to buy INR. His dealer quotes 1USD = 60 INR. So to buy INR 6000, he will <br />
            have to spend USD 100 (6000/60). Just as in previous example, he also faces some issues and <br />
            postpones his purchase by one month. After one month, you are again willing to sell the cycle at <br />
            INR 6000, but suppose USD appreciated. Now it becomes USD 1 = INR 65. Thus, the US buyer will <br />
            only have to pay USD 92.5, in order to buy the same product.<br /><br />
            Above examples make it very clear that when foreign currency appreciates (domestic currency <br />
            depreciates), local goods become cheaper in other countries, as foreigners will have to pay less <br />
            to buy the same amount of INR. At the same time, it makes foreign goods costly as you will have <br />
            to pay more to buy each unit of foreign currency. So when local currency depreciates, imports <br />
            become costly and price of exported goods becomes cheap for foreign nationals. As price of <br />
            imported goods increases, demand for imported article decreases and as price of goods exported <br />
            becomes cheaper for foreigners, foreign demand for local goods increases. Hence we can now <br />
            conclude that domestic currency depreciation leads to higher exports and lower imports. <br />
            Opposite will happen when domestic currency appreciates.<br /><br />
            India is a major oil importer as it doesn’t produce sufficient crude oil to meet its energy demands. <br />
            Thus when rupee depreciates, it becomes more expensive for the Government to import oil. Higher oil <br />
            prices increases the overall price level, as explained in our article on stagflation. Thus, it <br />
            becomes important for many countries to ensure that their currency doesn’t excessively <br />
            depreciate. But if a country doesn’t import many things, then it would want local currency to <br />
            depreciate, so that local goods become cheaper in other countries and exports increases. <br />
            Countries with excessive focus on exports use currency depreciation technique to boost their <br />
            exports.<br /><br />
