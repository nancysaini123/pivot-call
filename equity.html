        Exchanges
    </h5>
    <p><b>
        Drivers of economic growth</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Stock exchanges are marketplaces where shares are bought and sold. Companies looking to raise <br />
      funds can issue shares on stock exchange, i.e essentially sell shares. Market Participants (other <br />
      companies, retail investors, banks, insurance firms etc) buy these shares, allowing sellers to raise <br />
      the required amount. Once shares are bought by market participants the shares are considered to <br />
      have gone “public”. These shares can now be bought and sold at will on the stock exchange by <br />
      the market participants. Price of each share is determined by laws of demand and supply. Higher <br />
      the demand, greater the share price and vice versa. Most of the trading in India takes place on <br />
      two major stock exchanges, namely the BSE (Bombay stock exchange) and the NSE (National <br />
      stock exchange). NSE is the biggest stock exchange in India, in terms of total volume of shares <br />
      bought and sold.<br /><br />
      Like shares, other instruments such as options, futures,bonds etc. are also traded by market <br />
      participants on exchanges. Only registered market participants/members can trade on stock <br />
      exchanges. So when retail investors want to buy or sell shares they need to do so through these <br />
      registered members, who are called “stock brokers”. These brokers get the investor to open an <br />
      account with them, which allows them to access all the required details of the client. Stock <br />
      brokers then act as middlemen between investors and exchange and facilitate buying and selling <br />
      of shares, in return they charge a brokerage fee for their services.<br /><br />
      Exchanges play a very important role in the economic growth of the country. Economy grows <br />
      when new jobs are created, new jobs are created when companies open new factories, new <br />
      factories are opened when firms have sufficient funds required to make these investments and <br />
      exchanges help these firms raise funds for investment.<br /><br />
      Let’s now understand how trades are executed and orders are placed at an exchange.<br /><br />

          Trading Mechanisms and types of orders

        In our previous post, we discussed how exchanges facilitate buying and selling of shares between <br />
        market participants and the role of brokers in the process. In this article let’s discuss how orders <br />
        to buy/sell shares are placed on an exchange.<br /><br />
        Let’s assume you decide to buy 1 kg of tomatoes from the nearby vegetable market at not more <br />
        than Rs.10/kg. You go to the market and see that there are five vendors, all selling tomatoes at Rs <br />
        15/Kg. You start negotiating with each one of them and realize that there can be two outcomes:<br /><br />
        Outcome 1: Just like you other customers are also demanding lower price. Seeing this vendors will <br />
        start reducing the price, as nobody is willing to buy tomatoes at Rs 15/kg. It might happen that <br />
        the price comes down to Rs 10/kg and after buying 1 kg tomato you go home happily,<br /><br />
        Outcome 2: Unlike you, others are willing to pay the price of Rs.15/kg demanded by vendors. As <br />
        vendors will be able to clear their stock at higher price, prices will never come down. In this case <br />
        you won’t be able to buy tomatoes at Rs.10/kg and will return empty handed.<br /><br />
        In the above example, you are the buyer, tomato vendors are the sellers and tomatoes are the <br />
        commodities (underlying). Similarly on the exchange, there are many buyers and sellers and the <br />
        underlying could be anything: stock, bond etc. The entire trading process takes place on an <br />
        electronic system where buy and sell orders are matched. Just like in our example, suppose now <br />
        you want to buy 1 share of a company A at Rs 100, currently trading at a price of Rs 108. Lets us <br />
        discuss the different types of orders that can be placed to execute the above order.<br /><br />
        <b>Types of orders</b><br /><br />
        <b>Limit Order:</b> You can key in an order into your computer to buy 1 share of company A at Rs.100. <br />
        Just as in our earlier example there are 2 possibilities. If lot of people are demanding shares of <br />
        company A, at Rs.100 and nobody is willing to pay the current market price of Rs.108, prices will <br />
        automatically come down to match demand and you might be able to buy at Rs.100 or even lower <br />
        than that. However if other buyers are comfortable paying Rs.108, then prices will not come down <br />
        to your desired level and you will not be able to buy the shares. In a limit order, the order will get <br />
        executed at your desired price or at a better price – i.e. at the limit price or a lower price in case of <br />
        a buy order, and conversely, at the limit price or a higher price in case of a sell order. This order <br />
        type is advantageous when the investor wants to buy/sell at a particular price and does not mind <br />
        waiting for that price.<br /><br />
        <b>Market Order:</b> In this case you key in an order to buy/sell the shares immediately at the current <br />
        market price. Your priority is speed of order execution and you do not care about the direction of <br />
        price movement. In this case you might end up buying at a higher price or selling at a lower price, <br />
        as price might increase/decrease by the time order is executed.<br /><br />
        <b>Stop Loss order: </b>This is a risk averse investors favorite. Suppose after buying the shares at Rs.100 <br />
        you are now concerned that the price might fall further and do not want to make a huge loss. So <br />
        you can enter a stop loss order at a price lower than your purchase price. Let’s assume you do not <br />
        want to lose more than Rs.5 on your purchase, a stop loss order can be put in at Rs.95. If the price <br />
        starts to trend down and hits Rs.95 shares will be sold and your loss will be minimised to Rs.5.  <br /><br />
        <b>Duration order:</b> This order variety allows you to specify the time till when the order you placed <br />
        stays open. Let’s suppose you enter a limit order and make it “Good for the day”. In this case, if <br />
        the order is not executed by the end of the day then it will automatically get cancelled. However if <br />
        you place “Good until cancelled” order, then the order will remain open/active until the price <br />
        comes down to your desired level and you are able to buy the share.<br /><br />
