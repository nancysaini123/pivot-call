        Your best friend</b>

    <p>
      You might have seen technical analysts analyzing charts on various business news channels and <br />
      telling that a particular stock is in uptrend/downtrend. When we say a stock is in uptrend it means <br />
      that we expect stock price to move upwards in near future. Similarly, when we say a stock is in <br />
      downtrend it means we expect stock price to move downwards in near future. You would have <br />
      noticed that prices rarely move in a straight line. Even if the stock price has moved up, over the <br />
      last year, there will be days or months when it would have moved down, compared to the previous <br />
      close. So how do we define a trend? Technical Analysis says that if the stock price is moving up <br />
      and making higher highs and higher lows, it is in uptrend. Let’s understand this through an <br />
      example.<br /><br />
      Suppose you decide to analyze traffic situation at a nearby signal. You know that signal becomes <br />
      green in every 5 mins and remains open for the next 5 mins. At 6pm you observe that there are <br />
      100 cars waiting at the signal which just turned red. The signal will become green at 6:05 pm and <br />
      will again become red at 6:10 pm. You observe that in every 5 mins 30 cars arrive at the signal and <br />
      add up to the queue. In the 5 mins, when signal is open, 50 cars pass by. Let’s note down your <br />
      observations at various points of time<br /><br />
      <img src="ta.jpg" alt=""><br />
      Let’s say you observe that around 7 pm, it starts getting less congested and only 25 cars are <br />
      added to the queue in every 5 mins, instead of 30 cars. Previously 60 cars were getting added to <br />
      the queue in every 10 mins and only 50 were moving out, as the signal only opens for 5 mins in a <br />
      10 min window. After 7 pm the situation has changed. Now, only 50 cars are getting added in <br />
      every 10 mins and we know that same number of cars will move out, in 5 mins when the signal is <br />
      open. So now the traffic has become stagnate. It’s neither increasing nor decreasing, as 25 cars <br />
      are added in every 5 mins but in next 5 mins, 50 move out. This situation is depicted by the <br />
      middle part of the chart below.<br /><br />
      After 7:30 pm, you observe that only 20 cars are getting added to the queue. Now the pattern will <br />
      make lower highs and lower lows. We recommend trying this scenario yourself. Traffic situation <br />
      will improve because we know that only 40 cars are added to the queue in every 10 mins and 50 <br />
      cars are moving out. We can clearly say that no of cars at the signal are in downtrend and now we <br />
      expect them to decrease with time.<br /><br />
      <img src="ch.jpg" alt="">
      If we join all the highs, it’s called resistance. If we join all the lows, it’s called support. Keep <br />
      reading, as we go in details of trend, support and resistance in our next post.<br /><br />

          Trading Mechanisms and types of orders

        In our previous post, we discussed how exchanges facilitate buying and selling of shares between <br />
        market participants and the role of brokers in the process. In this article let’s discuss how orders <br />
        to buy/sell shares are placed on an exchange.<br /><br />
        Let’s assume you decide to buy 1 kg of tomatoes from the nearby vegetable market at not more <br />
        than Rs.10/kg. You go to the market and see that there are five vendors, all selling tomatoes at Rs <br />
        15/Kg. You start negotiating with each one of them and realize that there can be two outcomes:<br /><br />
        Outcome 1: Just like you other customers are also demanding lower price. Seeing this vendors will <br />
        start reducing the price, as nobody is willing to buy tomatoes at Rs 15/kg. It might happen that <br />
        the price comes down to Rs 10/kg and after buying 1 kg tomato you go home happily,<br /><br />
        Outcome 2: Unlike you, others are willing to pay the price of Rs.15/kg demanded by vendors. As <br />
        vendors will be able to clear their stock at higher price, prices will never come down. In this case <br />
        you won’t be able to buy tomatoes at Rs.10/kg and will return empty handed.<br /><br />
        In the above example, you are the buyer, tomato vendors are the sellers and tomatoes are the <br />
        commodities (underlying). Similarly on the exchange, there are many buyers and sellers and the <br />
        underlying could be anything: stock, bond etc. The entire trading process takes place on an <br />
        electronic system where buy and sell orders are matched. Just like in our example, suppose now <br />
        you want to buy 1 share of a company A at Rs 100, currently trading at a price of Rs 108. Lets us <br />
        discuss the different types of orders that can be placed to execute the above order.<br /><br />
        <b>Types of orders</b><br /><br />
        <b>Limit Order:</b> You can key in an order into your computer to buy 1 share of company A at Rs.100. <br />
        Just as in our earlier example there are 2 possibilities. If lot of people are demanding shares of <br />
        company A, at Rs.100 and nobody is willing to pay the current market price of Rs.108, prices will <br />
        automatically come down to match demand and you might be able to buy at Rs.100 or even lower <br />
        than that. However if other buyers are comfortable paying Rs.108, then prices will not come down <br />
        to your desired level and you will not be able to buy the shares. In a limit order, the order will get <br />
        executed at your desired price or at a better price – i.e. at the limit price or a lower price in case of <br />
        a buy order, and conversely, at the limit price or a higher price in case of a sell order. This order <br />
        type is advantageous when the investor wants to buy/sell at a particular price and does not mind <br />
        waiting for that price.<br /><br />
        <b>Market Order:</b> In this case you key in an order to buy/sell the shares immediately at the current <br />
        market price. Your priority is speed of order execution and you do not care about the direction of <br />
        price movement. In this case you might end up buying at a higher price or selling at a lower price, <br />
        as price might increase/decrease by the time order is executed.<br /><br />
        <b>Stop Loss order: </b>This is a risk averse investors favorite. Suppose after buying the shares at Rs.100 <br />
        you are now concerned that the price might fall further and do not want to make a huge loss. So <br />
        you can enter a stop loss order at a price lower than your purchase price. Let’s assume you do not <br />
        want to lose more than Rs.5 on your purchase, a stop loss order can be put in at Rs.95. If the price <br />
        starts to trend down and hits Rs.95 shares will be sold and your loss will be minimised to Rs.5.  <br /><br />
        <b>Duration order:</b> This order variety allows you to specify the time till when the order you placed <br />
        stays open. Let’s suppose you enter a limit order and make it “Good for the day”. In this case, if <br />
        the order is not executed by the end of the day then it will automatically get cancelled. However if <br />
        you place “Good until cancelled” order, then the order will remain open/active until the price <br />
        comes down to your desired level and you are able to buy the share.<br /><br />
