        A buy is a sell</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s discuss this concept using an example. Suppose you want to measure the number of <br />
      transactions taking place during a working day in the nearby fruit market. The market opens at <br />
      9.30 AM every day and closes by 5 PM. Note that the number of transactions are always measured <br />
      for a particular period, say 1 hour or 15 minutes and not at any particular moment like 10.12 AM. <br />
      Another important point is that number of transactions is not the sum of buy and sell activities, <br />
      but the total number of buy or sell activities which is equal to the total number of sell or buy <br />
      activities. This is because one cannot buy unless someone else is willing to sell. So if at 10.45 AM, <br />
      one were to say 200 transactions have taken place, it means that since 9.30 AM 200 people have <br />
      bought and sold fruits.<br /><br />
      Now let’s replace fruits with stocks and transactions with volume in the above example. Volume of <br />
      a stock is the total number of transactions taking place in a stock during a particular time period. <br />
      If one were to say that volume of a stock at 10.45 AM is 50,000, it means that since the open of <br />
      the market at 9.20 AM a particular stock has been bought and sold 50,000 times. Just like price, <br />
      volume is an important indicator to understand whether money is moving into or away from a <br />
      particular stock. In the case of fruit market, if more transactions are taking place in mangoes <br />
      compared to other fruits, it can be interpreted that more people want to buy and sell mangoes <br />
      compared to other fruits. This increase in interest could be because of two different reasons. One <br />
      reason might be that more people are buying mangoes and hence demand is increasing causing <br />
      price to increase. Alternatively suppliers might have stocked up mangoes in huge quantities <br />
      which they want to sell off, so they are enticing buyers by decreasing prices. Similarly, sudden <br />
      increase in volume of a stock could be because of two reasons. Increased demand for the stock <br />
      might have pushed up activity in the counter leading to price increase. Alternatively, current <br />
      shareholders might be selling the stock in droves, increasing activity in the counter thereby <br />
      lowering prices.<br /><br />
      Volume also indicates liquidity available for a stock. Liquidity refers to the ease with which a stock <br />
      can be bought or sold in the market without affecting its price. To understand this better let’s <br />
      revisit our example of fruits market. Suppose you have a stock of 50,000 apples that have to be <br />
      sold. Current market price of a single apple is Rs.25 and 40,000 apples were sold in the market <br />
      the previous day. If you decide to sell all 50,000 apples today, supply of apples in the market will <br />
      drastically increase compared to the previous day’s level and hence price will probably drop down <br />
      below Rs.25. But suppose, previous day was holiday and you believe apple sales suffered because <br />
      of the same. The best alternative then is to calculate the average number of transactions over the <br />
      past one month to smoothen the effect of abnormally high or low transaction numbers. Suppose <br />
      average number of transactions over the past one month is 20,00,000 apples a day.  Now you can <br />
      be sure that attempting to sell 50,000 apples a day will not affect price as market offers sufficient <br />
      liquidity for apples. The same analogy applies in case of buying and selling stocks as well. <br />
      Whenever an investor wants to buy/sell stocks in huge lots, it is prudent to check the average <br />
      volume over the past 1 month / 3 months to make sure that price impact is limited.<br /><br />
      We discussed trends in our previous article. If volume is increasing in a bull trend, it means that <br />
      momentum is increasing and more and more people are joining the trend. Suppose volumes are <br />
      decreasing in a bull trend we can assume the the stock is losing momentum and the trend might <br />
      reverse soon. The same logic applies in case of other trends as well.<br /><br />
