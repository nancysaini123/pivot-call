        What is a chart?
    </h5>
    <p><b>
        Making sense of data</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Charts/graphs make data analysis and interpretation very easy. Suppose, if we give you last 5 <br />
      years of daily price data of TATA motors, you cannot conclude anything just by looking at the <br />
      numbers because of the sheer volume of data. But if we make a graph by plotting this data and <br />
      then show it to you, you can easily find out what happened to the stock price near last Diwali or <br />
      which were the periods when it went up/down. Thus, understanding charts become very <br />
      important for investment analysis.<br /><br />
      Generally, we deal with 2-dimentional charts with time on horizontal axis and price/volume/other <br />
      parameters on vertical axis. To understand what information is presented by every single point on <br />
      a 2D chart, we can drop a straight line parallel to vertical axis on horizontal axis and a straight line <br />
      parallel to horizontal axis cutting vertical axis. Suppose, the point at which line cuts horizontal <br />
      axis is x and the point at which other line cuts vertical axis is Y, then the point represents that the <br />
      price of the stock was Rs Y on X date. Horizontal axis can have different time units as smallest <br />
      interval: seconds, minutes, days, weeks etc. In a graph with smallest horizontal unit as seconds, <br />
      we would be plotting prices at each and every second. When the unit is week, we will have just <br />
      one price for every week and we would be plotting these prices for different weeks. It could be <br />
      weekly average price, last traded price or first traded price, depending on the requirement. If I <br />
      want to plot last year’s price series of a stock, and keep day as the smallest unit for time axis, I <br />
      need 365 data points to complete my graph. For the same time period, if I keep week as my <br />
      smallest unit, I will need only 52 data points, as there are only this many weeks in a year.<br /><br />
      To make this clear, we have shown three graphs below. All graphs plot 3 months stock price <br />
      movement for Maruti. First chart uses day as the smallest unit and is constructed by plotting daily <br />
      prices for 3 months.<br /><br />
      <img src="daily.jpg" alt="business cycles" class="bc"><br />
      The second chart below uses a week as the smallest unit.<br /><br />
      <img src="weekly.jpg" alt="business cycles" class="bc"><br />
      We can easily see that first chart shows more information, compared to the second one. We can <br />
      only see average price for every week in the second chart, and not what happened during the <br />
      week – whether price initially went up then came down or vice versa. In general, charts with small <br />
      intervals show more details. Just like horizontal axis’s smallest interval, vertical axis’s smallest <br />
      interval also matters a lot. In first two graphs, smallest interval for vertical axis is 300. Suppose, <br />
      instead of 300 it was 3000, then after 3900 the next point would have been 4900 directly. In this <br />
      case the whole graph will shrink, as shown in the 3rd chart.<br /><br />

      Let’s now learn more about various types of charts.<br /><br />

          Types of Charts
      </h5>
      <p>
        In our last article, we learnt about construction and importance of charts in technical analysis. In <br />
        this article, we will be covering various types of charts, frequently used in technical analysis. <br />
        Before we go in details of these charts, let’s first quickly understand few terms associated with <br />
        price of a security (shares/bonds/derivatives)<br /><br />
        <b>Open price:</b> price at which first trade happens, after market opens for the day<br /><br />
        <b>Close price:</b> price at which last trade of the day happens. Sometimes, it’s the average price <br />
        of last few minutes<br /><br />
        <b>High price:</b> highest price attained by the security, during the daily trading session<br /><br />
        <b>Low price:</b> lowest trading price during the daily trading session<br /><br />
        <b>Line chart</b><br /><br />
        <img src="policyd.jpg" alt="business cycles" class="bc"><br /><br />
        It is constructed by joining various data points at different time intervals through a straight line. As <br />
        discussed in the last article, no of data points varies according to unit chosen for horizontal axis. <br />
        Below is the line chart that we discussed in our last article. It is constructed using last 3 months <br />
        daily close price and has day as the smallest unit on horizontal axis.<br /><br />
        <b>Bar chart</b><br /><br />
        <img src="high.jpg" alt="business cycles" class="bc"><br /><br />
        It shows a lot more information, compared to a line chart. In line chart, we joined all the data <br />
        points using a straight line. Here, we don’t join these data points. As shown in the chart below, at <br />
        each unit of time (horizontal axis), a vertical line is constructed. So for the same Maruti chart that <br />
        we plotted above, a bar chart will have 90 vertical lines for 3 months – one line for each day. Top <br />
        most point of the line shows high price of that day. Bottom most point depicts the low price of <br />
        daily trading session. Also, you can see a small horizontal dash cutting each of the vertical lines. It<br />
         represents daily close price. If we join all the points at which these small dashes are cutting <br />
         vertical lines, we will again get the line chart that we discussed in our previous point. Apart from <br />
         high, low and close price information, there is one more very important thing that bar charts <br />
         convey. The length of each vertical line shows the extant of daily price movement. If the length is <br />
         very high for a particular day, it means that there is big difference between highest and lowest <br />
         prices attained during that day’s trading session. Thus, a stock would have experienced high <br />
         volatility in that trading session.<br /><br />
         <b>Candlestick chart:</b><br /><br />
         <img src="candle.jpg" alt="business cycles" class="bc"><br /><br />
         As discussed in the previous point, bar chart shows information about high, low and close prices. <br />
         In addition to this, a candlestick chart also shows information about the open price. Again, a <br />
         vertical line is placed for each of the data point. So if we are using day as the smallest unit on <br />
         horizontal axis, we will be adding one vertical line for each day. Similar to bar chart, top point of <br />
         the vertical line will depict high price and bottom point will depict low price. But instead of dash, <br />
         now we add a bar on top of the vertical line, as shown in the chart below. These vertical bars can <br />
         be hollow/white or filled/black. A hollow bar tells us that close price is higher than the open price. <br />
         In this case, upper end of bar chart will show close price and lower end will show open price. <br />
         Length of the bar will depict difference between open and close price, while length of the line will <br />
         depict difference between high and low price. On the other hand, a filled bar represents a <br />
         scenario where close price is less than the open price. Here, lower end of the bar will show close <br />
         price and upper end will show open price. Thus, upper and lower end of bars always represents <br />
         close and open price, but which will depict what depends on whether it is filled or hollow.<br /><br />
         There is a lot more information conveyed by a candle chart, apart from the four price points that <br />
         we discussed. Let’s take an example. Suppose everyday there is a fight between a bull and a bear. <br />
         All the information about this daily fight is conveyed using a candlestick chart. In this case, <br />
         following would be the interpretation of different characteristics of a candle chart<br /><br />
         If bull wins the daily fight, it is represented by a hollow bar<br /><br />
         If bear wins the daily fight, it is represented by a filled bar<br /><br />
         The intensity of the fight is represented by the length of the line<br /><br />
         Length of the bar represents margin by which either one wins<br /><br />
         Now suppose bull means buyers in the market and bear means sellers. Every trading session is a <br />
         fight between buyers and sellers. If buyers win, stock price increase and close price is above the <br />
         open price. Thus, we get a hollow candle. It shows that buying pressure on the stock was much <br />
         more than the selling pressure, and length of the bar represents extent of difference. If sellers win, <br />
         it means selling pressure was more during the trading session and closing price would be less <br />
         than the open price. This would be represented by a filled bar. If we are continuously getting <br />
         hollow candles, in our example this would mean bear has become weak, as it is losing every day. <br />
         Similarly, in real life it would mean that buyers are outnumbering sellers and there is strong bullish <br />
         momentum in the stock. Opposite will happen in the case of filled candles.<br /><br />
