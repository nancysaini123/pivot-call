        Risk & Return - Sides of the same coin</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an inherent relationship between risk and return. High returns can’t be achieved without <br />
      taking appropriate risks. If you read autobiographies of any of the people who made it big in their <br />
      lives, you would realize that all of them would have taken appropriate risks at different points of <br />
      time. Same thing applies in the financial world also. Any rational person will be willing to take <br />
      more risk, only if it comes with a promise of better returns. Let’s start our discussion with an example.<br /><br />
      Horse betting is a game loved by many across the globe. It’s a fun game and if you are lucky, you <br />
      can make some quick bucks. Let’s assume there are 10 horses participating in a race and we need <br />
      to place our bet on one of them.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>
          Above table lists the multiplication factors of each of the 10 horses. Multiplication factor <br />
          represents the factor applied to your investment, if you win the bet. So if you put INR 30 on Horse <br />
          3 and it wins the race, you would receive INR 240 – your money will grow 8 times the initial <br />
          investment. Let’s try to answer why the multiplication factors of horses are different. The horse <br />
          with highest number of wins in the past will have the lowest factor, because it’s most likely that it <br />
          will win the race again (low risk, low return). The horse with lowest number of wins will have the <br />
          highest factor, as probability of it winning the race is low (high return, high risk). So if you bet INR <br />
          1000 on horse 10 and it wins the race, you would make INR 49,000 in just few minutes. You are <br />
          rewarded more, because you took a risky and unlikely bet. It doesn’t mean that you should take <br />
          risky bets. It means that if you take risky bets and win, you would be rewarded more.<br /><br />
          Horse 7 has the lowest multiplication factor, as it has historically been most consistent in winning <br />
          races. We can say that its performance is less volatile. On the other hand, Horse 8 has very high <br />
          multiplication factor, as its performance has been very inconsistent in the past. We can say that <br />
          the performance of Horse 8 is very volatile. If we were betting on stocks instead of horses, then <br />
          these multiplication factors would represent expected returns. As discussed, betting on horse 7 <br />
          was less risky due to its consistent nature, similarly betting on stock 7 would be less risky, due to <br />
          its low volatility. But the return that can be expected from this stock would also be low. Generally, <br />
          more volatile the returns (performance) of a security are, more risky it is.<br /><br />
          The concept becomes clearer in the chart below.<br /><br />
          <img src="chart.jpg" alt="" class="bc"><br />
          We have plotted the daily return of two stocks (A,B). We can clearly say that stock B is less volatile, <br />
          more stable and less risk than stock A. With stock A, we can end up making as high as 28% in a <br />
          given day or as low as -40%. With stock B, this range shrinks to -6% to 5%. With stock B, our <br />
          returns are more stable and we lose less when the market falls. But at the same time, we gain less <br />
          when the market rises, as we had avoided taking that risk.<br /><br />
