      Money
  </h5>
  <p>
    If someone wants to borrow INR 1,000 for a day and promises to return INR 10,000 the next day, <br />
    you might not believe him, as magic only happens in Harry Potter movies. But if that someone is a <br />
    bank, you better take it seriously. The article below explains how this magic works.<br /><br />
    Suppose there were no banks in the city you live in and the first bank opened today. You went to <br />
    the bank and deposited INR 1000. As per Government regulations, banks need to set aside at <br />
    least 10% of the deposit amount as reserve and rest can be lent out. It is easy to understand why <br />
    Government would want such a rule. If banks lend out the entire deposit amount, it will have none <br />
    left to meet depositor’s withdrawal requirement. Thus, banks retain some part of the money to <br />
    meet their liquidity requirements, before lending out the remaining amount. We will learn more <br />
    about this percentage requirement in future articles.<br /><br />
    Let’s come back to our example. You deposited INR 1000 with the bank, bank retained INR 100 <br />
    (10% of 1000) and loaned out the rest to a company seeking a loan of INR 900 to fund its capital <br />
    requirement. Company utilised this amount to buy tools and machinery, from a capital supplier, <br />
    for its new plant. This supplier, after receiving the money from company, went to the same bank <br />
    again and deposited INR 900.  In this roundabout way, money again came back to the bank in the <br />
    form of deposit, but it was 10% lesser than the original deposit amount. The below chain explains <br />
    this process.<br /><br />
    Now again as per Government rule, bank will have to retain 10% of the deposit and can lend rest <br />
    of the amount. This time bank will retain INR 90 (10% of INR 900) and will lend out only INR 810. <br />
    Let’s suppose bank lent INR 810 to a farmer, to buy seeds and fertilizers. The farmer bought these <br />
    from a fertilizer manufacturing company. The company, after receiving payment from the farmer, <br />
    returns to the  bank to deposit the money. Thus money again came back to the bank in the form of <br />
    deposit, but it was 10% lesser than the deposit amount of INR 900. The process can be seen in the <br />
    following flow chart.<br /><br />
    <img src="money.jpg" alt="" class="lc"><br />
    This process will keep on repeating. Every time bank receives a deposit it will retain 10% of the <br />
    deposit amount and lend out the balance.Sum of all these deposit amounts (INR 1000+ INR 900 + <br />
    INR 810 …) will add up to INR 10,000. As discussed in the beginning, if banks say they will convert <br />
    INR 1000 to INR 10,000, you better take it seriously. This shows how small amount of money <br />
    injected into the economy results in economic activity worth many folds larger than the amount <br />
    injected.<br /><br />
    Let’s learn more about money and the role played by central bank in the whole process.<br /><br />

        Central Bank
    </h5>
    <p><b>
        The big boss</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Central Bank is the single most important unit in the whole financial system. It is very easy to <br />
      understand the need and importance of a central bank. You must have seen a football or a <br />
      wrestling match. Ever tried to imagine what would happen if the referee is not present? In <br />
      wrestling, a wrestler can easily cheat and use wrong moves to defeat his opponent. Similarly, in a <br />
      football match, a goal might be claimed, even if scored after offside. Central bank is the big boss <br />
      and can be considered as referee of the banking system. The Central bank drafts rules that all <br />
      participants of the system need to adhere to and ensures implementation of these rules. <br /><br />
      Let us reconsider the example that we discussed in our previous article. We understood <br />
      everything about how money flows within the system and its multiplier effect, but we still don’t <br />
      know how money came into your hand, in the first place. It is the central bank of a country that <br />
      has all the rights and power to print money. A currency note is a promise by the Governor of <br />
      central bank of India that he will pay you the same amount of money in exchange for this note. <br />
      Suppose, I write on a stamp paper that I will give INR 1,000 to the holder of this stamp paper and <br />
      pass it on to you as a gift. You owe INR 1,000 to your friend Neha and decide to pay her using the <br />
      stamp paper, which can be converted to money any time. Neha accepted the stamp paper and <br />
      decided to buy groceries using the same and passed it on the shopkeeper, who in turn used it for <br />
      some other purpose. This is how paper currency got accepted in the society and circulation began.<br /><br />
      So far we have discussed two important functions of the Central bank. First one is to draft and <br />
      implement regulations for the banking system. Central bank decides criteria regarding who <br /><br />
      should be allowed to operate a bank, minimum documents required to open a bank account, <br />
      amount of money banks should hold as reserve to safeguard depositors money in case of crisis <br />
      etc. They provide a level playing field to all banks and also ensure that customer interest is <br />
      safeguarded. The second function of Central bank is to print money.<br /><br />
      In addition to this, central bank is also responsible for controlling inflation in a country. As <br />
      discussed previously, inflation can be of two types: demand pull and cost push. If central bank <br />
      prints too much of money and this extra money flows into the system, it will result in a case of too <br />
      much money chasing too few goods. This is exactly what happens in the case of demand pull <br />
      inflation. So when inflation is high, central banks reduce injecting money into the economy. When <br />
      inflation is low central bank pumps more money into the economy to drive up inflation. As <br />
      discussed earlier in our article on forex, if central bank prints too much money thereby increasing <br />
      its supply, the currency will depreciate and its value will come down. Too little printing can lead to <br />
      appreciation of currency as well. Thus, another important job of the central bank is to control <br />
      currency fluctuations in the forex market.<br /><br />
      To conclude central banks are the big boss of the banking system, they design rules of the game, <br />
      ensure all banks follow the same, control money supply, target inflation and closely watch and <br />
      safeguard the economy against unwanted currency fluctuations.<br /><br />
      Read on to understand how central banks inject money in the economy.<br /><br />

            Monetary Policy Instruments
        </h5>
        <p>
          The previous article details Central bank’s functions and it’s importance in the financial system. In <br />
          today’s world, inflation targeting and control of money flow in order to ensure price stability takes <br />
          precedence over all other tasks of the Central bank. The bank uses different processes and adopts <br />
          various instruments to achieve this objective. Some of the  important ones are explained below:<br /><br />
          <b>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):</b> Let’s again go back to the example where we understood how more <br />
          money is created in the economy and how money multiplier works. As soon as a deposit was <br />
          made, the bank was required to retain a certain portion of the deposit and was free to lend the <br />
          balance amount. The percentage of deposit that the bank is required to retain is called “cash <br />
          reserve ratio”. So if an individual deposits Rs 100 with the bank and CRR is 5%, banks need to <br />
          retain Rs 5 in reserve and can lend rest of the money to borrowers. The main objective of CRR is to <br />
          ensure that banks have sufficient cash, in order to meet withdrawal requirements of their <br />
          customers. It works on the assumption that all depositors do not demand their money back on the <br />
          same day and only a small percentage of the total population do so. In India, Reserve Bank of <br />
          India (RBI) sets the CRR ratio and banks are required to deposit the same with RBI.  <br /><br />
          <b>Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR):</b> It can be thought of as an addition requirement like CRR where <br />
          banks are required to retain certain percentage of total deposits in cash and cash equivalents. The <br />
          main objective of this exercise is to ensure that banks have sufficient liquid balance to meet <br />
          customer’s demand for cash. Suppose funds are invested in real estate property or used to buy <br />
          stake in a company, then it cannot be easily liquified. It will take time to sell stake in a company or <br />
          sell land/real estate. However investing in gold or Government securities is prudent as these <br />
          instruments can be readily converted to cash. Gold has a standard price and can be easily <br />
          converted to cash by exchanging with other banks or selling in the market. Read more about <br />
          Government securities below.<br /><br />
          <b>Open Market Operations:</b> When individuals need funds, they can borrow the same from banks. <br />
          This transaction involves promise of payback within a certain time period and payment of interest <br />
          on the borrowed amount. Similarly when Government wants to borrow money, it does so by <br />
          issuing securities called treasury bill/bond. Suppose Government wants to borrow Rs 1000, it can <br />
          issue a treasury bond which promises pay back of Rs 1000 in 5 years and an interest rate of 8%. <br />
          RBI handles Government’s borrowing activities. In open market operations, RBI either buys these <br />
          securities from financial institutions like banks or sells it to them. If RBI is buying from banks, it <br />
          means RBI is paying money to banks, which will then be loaned out thereby pumping more money <br />
          into the system. If RBI is selling to banks, then banks are paying money and buying these <br />
          securities thereby reducing the cash available to provide loans.This has the effect of sucking <br />
          money out of the system.<br /><br />
          <b>Repo and Reverse Repo Rate:</b> Just like individuals and governments, sometimes banks also need <br />
          money to fulfil their cash requirements. In such cases they can borrow money from RBI. The <br />
          interest rate at which banks borrow money from RBI is called repo rate. Sometimes banks also <br />
          have excess cash and like to earn interest on it. In such cases they can park the money with RBI <br />
          and earn interest on it. Interest rate received by banks for parking excess cash with RBI is called <br />
          reverse repo rate.<br /><br />

          Monetary Policy Mechanism
        </h5>
        <p>
          In the previous article we learnt about Central bank controlling money supply to the economy and <br />
          the instruments at its disposal to achieve this objective. This article elaborates on how Central <br />
          bank uses these tools to achieve its monetary policy objective.<br /><br />
          Suppose a central bank wants to pump in more money into the economy. This is called <br />
          expansionary monetary policy. Let’s see how this can be achieved using different tools:<br /><br />
          CRR: This is the percentage of deposit that the bank is required to retain and maintain as reserve <br />
          with RBI. Suppose current CRR is 6% and RBI reduces the same to 4%. The differential of 2% (6%<br />
          - 4%) has now been made available to banks, they can now withdraw this amount and lend the <br />
          same. Increased lending will lead to flow of money from banks into the economy, thereby <br />
          accomplishing RBI’s mission.  <br /><br />
          SLR: If the objective it to increase money supply then RBI can lower SLR. Suppose the current SLR <br />
          is 18%, and RBI lowers the same to 15%. Banks can redeem the 3% differential amount and utilise <br />
          the same for lending purposes. This extra money will flow into the economy.  <br /><br />
          Open Market Operations: If the Central bank wants to increase money supply, it can buy back <br />
          Government securities held by banks. This will put more funds in the hands of banks, which will <br />
          then lend out the same leading to increased money supply in the economy.<br /><br />
          Repo rate and reverse repo rate: Repo rate is the rate at which banks can borrow money from <br />
          Central banks. If Central bank reduces repo rate, then banks cost of borrowing goes down. <br />
          Suppose the repo rate drops from 7% to 6%, the 1% differential interest outflow that banks saved <br />
          on can be utilised to lend to borrowers. Lower interest rates might also encourage banks to <br />
          borrow more to lend. This will lead to more money flow into the economy.<br /><br />
          Reverse repo rate is the interest rate which Central banks pay other banks for funds parked with it. <br />
          Lowering reverse repo rate, will lead to lesser interest earnings for banks. Hence instead of <br />
          parking money with Central bank, banks will lend more to borrowers leading to increased money <br />
          supply.<br /><br />
          In a contrary situation, when central bank wants to take money out of the economy, it will reverse <br />
          its decisions in all the above cases. So CRR, SLR, repo rate & reverse repo rate will all increase and <br />
          Central bank will sell Government securities to suck money out of the system. This is called <br />
          contractionary monetary policy.<br /><br />
          Let’s now understand how central banks decide which economic policy, contractionary or <br />
          expansionary, to pursue.<br /><br />
        </p><br />
        <h5 id="policyd">
            Monetary Policy Decisions
        </h5>
        <p>
          In our previous article we learnt about how central banks achieve expansionary and <br />
          contractionary monetary policy objectives. In this article, let’s discuss how central banks decide <br />
          whether to pursue contractionary or expansionary monetary policy. But before that, we need to <br />
          understand how central banks control interest rates. Let’s do this using an example.<br /><br />
          You can probably recall the typical Zamindar and Lala characters in old Bollywood movies. They <br />
          used to be among the wealthiest people in the village and anybody in need of money used to go <br />
          to them for a loan. These villians used to take advantage of the situation and charge very high <br />
          interest rate on the loan. Suppose there is a very wealthy Zamindar – let’s call him Z, and he lends <br />
          money to less wealthy Zamindars in nearby villages. He charges 20% interest on loans. Less <br />
          wealthy Zamindars borrow money from Z at 20% and lend out the same to people in their village <br />
          at a slightly higher charge of 25%. The differential of 5% is the less wealthier Zamindars profit. <br />
          Now suppose Z, decides to raise interest rate charged to 23% from 20%. The smaller Zamindars <br />
          have choice of either raising interest rates and passing on the increased cost to the end borrower <br />
          or they can decide against raising interest rate thereby making lesser profits.  <br /><br />
          In our example, Z is the central bank and smaller zamindars are other local banks. We know that <br />
          local banks borrow money from central bank at repo rate. So if central bank decides to increase <br />
          the interest rate (repo rate), cost of borrowing funds increases for other banks. They pass this <br />
          onto the end customer by increasing their lending cost. Similarly, when central bank reduces repo <br />
          rate, cost of borrowing funds becomes cheap and profitability of banks increases. In such cases, <br />
          banks might pass on the benefits to their customers by lowering interest rates on funds lent out. <br />
          This is how interest rate increases everywhere when central bank increases repo and vice versa, <br />
          and that is how central banks control interest rates.<br /><br />
          As we learnt in our article on measuring GDP, GDP increases when investment by firms increase. <br />
          When interest rates are low, cost of borrowing funds are cheap. When firms can borrow easily at <br />
          cheaper rates, they increase their investments and this ultimately leads to higher GDP.<br /><br />
          When economy is going through a recession and GDP is contracting, Central bank can help by <br />
          adopting an expansionary monetary policy. As discussed earlier expansionary monetary policy, <br />
          pursued through either CRR, SLR, open market operations or repo rate route, will result in more <br />
          funds with banks. If funds are easily made available to banks at lower rates, they will lend out the <br />
          same to firms at the same lower rate. Lower borrowing cost for firms results into higher <br />
          investments in the form of new factories and manufacturing units. This results into higher <br />
          employment, higher incomes and ultimately  results in higher GDP.<br /><br />
          Now let us look at the different types of deficits that we read about daily<br /><br />
