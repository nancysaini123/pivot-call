        How you control the entire production process</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Market is a very common term used by all of us on a daily basis. Any place enabling buyers and <br />
      sellers of a particular good/service to interact with each other is called market. If there is a place <br />
      where buyers and sellers of sugar are coming together and trading with each other, it will be <br />
      called a sugar market. Similarly, if buyers and sellers of furniture are trading with each other on <br />
      an online portal, then that portal is also a furniture market.<br /><br />
      Suppose you want to set up a cloth manufacturing unit. First thing that you would need is a piece <br />
      of land to setup the factory. Once you have the land, you need capital. By capital, we are referring <br />
      to related infrastructure like factory building, machines and software systems. Finally, you would <br />
      be needing people to work in your factory, called labor. These are the three essential things that <br />
      are always required for production and are called factors of production. Now the next question, <br />
      where will you obtain them from? You would be buying these factors from other individuals. You <br />
      can very well argue that you can buy them from other firms as well, but ultimately somebody <br />
      would have bought it from individuals.<br /><br />
      Let’s divide the whole economy into two parts, firms and households. All land, capital and labour <br />
      ultimately belongs to households, let’s consider these households as individual families. Firms will <br />
      be buying these 3 factors of production from households. So we have firms who are the buyer’s, <br />
      households are the seller’s and factors of production as the product. As per our definition of <br />
      market,  this setup would be called a factor market.<br /><br />
      Let’s now revisit our example where you were trying to setup a cloth manufacturing unit. Suppose, <br />
      now the factory is set up and you begin manufacturing. Who will buy your products? Again it’s the <br />
      households (individuals) who would be buying your products in the cloth market. Let’s broaden <br />
      our example and think about who would be buying all the finished goods manufactured in the <br />
      economy, it will be the households who would be buying these products. Thus, in finished goods <br />
      market, firms are the sellers and households are the buyer’s.<br /><br />
      As we saw, firms buy factors of production from households in factor market. Then they <br />
      manufacture finished goods using these factors of production and sell it back to households in <br />
      finished goods market. Full circular process can be seen in the figure below.<br /><br />
      <img src="flow.png" alt="" class="bc"><br />
      Let’s now try and understand how money flows in the whole process.<br /><br />
    </p><br />
      <h5 id="income">
          Circular Flow of Income
      </h5>
      <p><b>
          Spend.. it's all coming back to you</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the previous article, “Circular flow of products” we saw how products flow in the economy. <br />
        Firms buy factors of production from households in the factor market and sell finished goods <br />
        back to them in the finished goods market.<br /><br />
        When firms buy factors of production (land, capital and labor) from the factor market, they need <br />
        to reimburse households for the same. Thus, in factor market money is flowing from firms to <br />
        households. Money spent by firms is their cost of production and earnings for the households. In <br />
        the finished goods markets, firms are selling their products to households, so money is flowing <br />
        from households to firms. As shown in the diagram below money and products flow in opposite <br />
        directions, money moves clockwise and products flow anti clockwise. The cumulative amount <br />
        spent by households is equal to the revenue of the firms. The difference between the amount <br />
        earned by firms in the finished goods market and the money spent by firms in the factor market is <br />
        the firm’s profit.<br /><br />
        <img src="income.jpg" alt="" class="bc"><br />
        The diagram also makes it obvious that expenditure of one entity is equal to total income of <br />
        another; applying the same working to the entire economy, total expenditure in the economy is <br />
        always equal to the total income.<br /><br />
        Let’s talk a little more about the income received by households. In the factor market, households <br />
        earn various kinds of income from firms. Income received for renting out land is termed rent. In <br />
        return for labor provided by household’s, they receive salary/wages and capital earns interest. It is <br />
        easy to understand how land would earn rent and labor would earn wages/salary, but <br />
        understanding how capital earns interest is a little difficult.<br /><br />
        Let’s now see how capital, which we earlier defined as machinery, tools and technology earns <br />
        interest for households.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <h5 id="Leakages">
              Leakages in the Circular Flow
          </h5>
          <p><b>
              How your savings finance corporate investment</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            To complete our understanding of circular flow, lets now learn about leakages from the same. 3 <br />
            new entities will now be introduced into the circular flow to explain how they create leakages.<br /><br />
            <img src="lflow.jpg" alt="" class="lc"><br />
            <b>1.Introducing Government</b><br />
            The first entity that is being introduced is Government and it is at the center of the circular flow. <br />
            Government collects taxes from both individuals and firms. A part of the money received by <br />
            individuals in factor market, in exchange for land, labor and capital, will be collected by the <br />
            government as tax. Similarly, a part of the money received by firms in return for finished goods <br />
            will be collected by the government as corporate tax. Government collects taxes so that the <br />
            amount can be spent for public welfare by creating public goods. Public goods are goods and <br />
            services available and useful to all members of the society. This usually includes roads, ports, <br />
            railways, schools & colleges, hospitals etc.   <br /><br />
            <b>2.Introducing External Sector</b><br />
            External sector is linked to the finished goods market. Foreign entities buying finished goods <br />
            manufactured in a country, say India, i.e. exports, results in injection of money into the economy. <br />
            Similarly, Indians buying foreign finished goods, i.e imports, results in money flowing out of the <br />
            economy.<br /><br />
            <b>3.Introducing Financial Sector</b><br />
            Financial sector is linked to the factor market. In our previous article, we mentioned that <br />
            expenditure by firms on capital items like machinery, tools and technology in factor market results <br />
            in interest income for households. Households earn rent and wages from factor market. A part of <br />
            this earning is saved in banks for future needs and only remaining balance is spent in finished <br />
            goods market. This act of saving, results in a leakage and money flows out of the circular flow. <br />
            borrow money from banks in order to fund their capital related expenditure. This way <br />
            money is again injected into the economy and in the process firms pay interest to banks for <br />
            borrowing money. Banks pass on some part of that interest earned to households, in return for <br />
             their funds. Thus households are saving funds and depositing the same in banks. This <br />
             kitty is then lent out by banks to firms, to fund their capital needs. So in a roundabout way <br />
             households enable firms to buy capital and in the process earn interest. Banks facilitate the entire <br />
             process.<br /><br />
             Now that our understanding of circular flow is complete, we can easily use the same to learn how <br />
             GDP is measured in any economy.<br /><br />
          </p><br />
          <h5 id="gdb">
            Measuring GDP
          </h5>
          <p><b>
              The recipe</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding how to measure gross domestic produce (GDP) becomes very easy after learning <br />
            circular flow of income. We recommend reading our previous three articles on circular flow of <br />
            products and money before continuing on. As discussed in an earlier article, GDP is the value of <br />
            final goods and services produced domestically in a given time period. When we say GDP of India <br />
            was USD 2.3 trillion in financial year 2015, we mean that total value of all goods and services <br />
            produced in the Indian economy between April 2014 and March 2015 was USD 2.3 trillion.<br /><br />
            In order to measure GDP, we need to calculate the expenditure incurred on producing all the <br />
            goods and services. Obviously, goods and services produced in the economy will get consumed <br />
            generating income for producers. From our previous article on circular flow of income we know <br />
            that income is equal to expenditure. So if we can measure the total spending on goods and <br />
            services in the economy, we will be able to arrive at the total GDP figure. Hence we can either use <br />
            the total expenditure or total income approach to calculate total GDP.<br /><br />
            <img src="gdp.jpg" alt="" class="lc"><br />
            Let’s discuss the expenditure approach. From the above diagram, we can see that there are 4 <br />
            major spenders in the economy. Households are spending on purchasing goods and services <br />
            produced by firms, firms are spending on their factor requirements, Government is spending to <br />
            create public goods and finally foreigners are spending to buy domestic goods.<br /><br /></p>
            <h6>Total Expenditure = Household expenditure on goods and service (C) + Firm expenditure on <br />
              capital and other factors (I)+ Government’s expenditure on public goods (G)+ Foreigners net <br />
              expenditure on exports (X-M)<br /><br />
              GDP = C + I + G + (X – M)</h6>
            <p>
              Here, C is the consumption by households, I is defined as the investment by firms, G is the <br />
              government expenditure and X-M is export minus imports. This is how GDP is measured in the <br />
              expenditure approach.<br /><br />
              If any of the above 4 things increase, GDP of the country will also increase. If households are <br />
              consuming more because of rising levels of income, then GDP will increase. If firms are investing <br />
              more, because borrowing money has become easy due to low interest rates, then GDP will <br />
              increase. If Government is spending more on public goods, then GDP will increase. Finally, if <br />
              exports are rising faster than imports, even then GDP will increase.<br /><br />
              The above concept will become clearer in the next posts. Read on.<br /><br />
